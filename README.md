# SpicyThai
In class project for Food Service

I really liked the extension methods, during Sports Store chapter 9 I was confused about them
but then doing them in Spicy Thai I started to understand them. I think the hardest thing that I'm still
struggling with is the database syntax. The database syntax that goes into the controllers is kind of throwing me 
for a loop right now. So I'm going to go back and look at it some more as well as search on plurasight for some videos on 
that stuff.

Everything is starting to make sense, it's a lot to take in but everything is coming together nicely for me.
The image stuff was a little difficult to grasp at first and I struggled mostly with the delete method of
menu item. For a while I was getting an error when I would try to delete a menuItem that didn't have an image associated
with it or had just the defaut image associated with it. But I eventually figured out.

This was pretty easy adding the edit, details, and delete pages since we have done it 3 other times now. I found it really easy as well
to add the coupon images to the edit, details, and delete pages. I like just uploading the image to the database rather than saving it
as a file in wwwroot. Makes dealing with the deleation and editing of the image a lot easier when you don't have to change the image path.

It was nice learing how to do the log in and registering functionality and seeing how it is done and thinking to myself while learning 
this how I could use it for our group project. It'll be cool to see the differences between what we did here and what our group does for the group project.

It was nice to get the functionality of the Spicy Thai cart down and finished for the most part. Sessions are an interesting concept in C#
and I look forward to learning more about them and seeing if I can incorperate them into our group project. Spicy Thai was a great learing experience along with the other tutorials that we did. And I look forward to starting our group project.
