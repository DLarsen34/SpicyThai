# SpicyThai
In class project for Food Service

9/18
I really liked the extension methods, during Sports Store chapter 9 I was confused about them
but then doing them in Spicy Thai I started to understand them. I think the hardest thing that I'm still
struggling with is the database syntax. The database syntax that goes into the controllers is kind of throwing me 
for a loop right now. So I'm going to go back and look at it some more as well as search on plurasight for some videos on 
that stuff.
