# SpicyThai

I really liked the extension methods, during Sports Store chapter 9 I was confused about them
but then doing them in Spicy Thai I started to understand them. I think the hardest thing that I'm still
struggling with is the database syntax. The database syntax that goes into the controllers is kind of throwing me 
for a loop right now. So I'm going to go back and look at it some more as well as search on plurasight for some videos on 
that stuff.

Everything is starting to make sense, it's a lot to take in but everything is coming together nicely for me.
The image stuff was a little difficult to grasp at first and I struggled mostly with the delete method of
menu item. For a while I was getting an error when I would try to delete a menuItem that didn't have an image associated
with it or had just the defaut image associated with it. But I eventually figured out.
